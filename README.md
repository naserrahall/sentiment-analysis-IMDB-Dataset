# Sentiment Analysis Project using IMDB Dataset

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze sentiment in movie reviews using the **IMDB Dataset**. It involves data cleaning, text preprocessing, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify sentiments as positive or negative.

## Contents

- **Data Import:** Load and analyze the IMDB dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and remove unnecessary text.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Convert text into formats suitable for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Apply different algorithms for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measure classification accuracy using metrics like precision and recall.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run

1. Download the file `sentiment-analysis-project-imdb-dataset.ipynb`.
2. Open `Jupyter Notebook` using:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Execute the cells step by step to explore the analysis and results.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve text preprocessing using advanced techniques like **Word Embeddings**.
- Experiment with deep learning models such as **LSTM and BERT** for better classification accuracy.
- Conduct a more detailed analysis of sentence structures affecting sentiment classification.

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to modify the code, add enhancements, and share them via **GitHub**.
